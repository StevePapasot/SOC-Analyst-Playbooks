# Trigger

- Login attempts (failed or successful) for accounts in privileged groups (Domain Admins, IT admins, service accounts with high rights).
- Multiple failures on a privileged account or a successful login from an unusual IP/device.

# Quick Triage (L1 Steps)

- Alert Details → username, group membership, src IP, host, timestamp, event IDs.
- Check QRadar: Authentication success/failure events (4624/4625), account change events, group membership changes.
- Enrich IP & host: QRadar TI, reverse DNS, ASN, endpoint name and last known user.
- User Context: Is this a scheduled admin task, maintenance window, or known admin remote access?

# Decision Logic

- Known admin maintenance / scheduled run from known host/IP → monitor/close (FP).
- Multiple failures or success from malicious/unusual IP/device → escalate immediately.
- Privileged account used to access sensitive systems or other accounts → escalate.

# Escalation Criteria

Escalate if any:

- Successful login from unusual/malicious IP for privileged account.
- Multiple failed attempts followed by success on privileged account.
- New admin/group addition events coinciding with logins.
- Correlated alerts: lateral movement, suspicious process, data access spikes.

# L1 Actions

- Document time, privileged username, src IP, host, event IDs, group membership snapshot.
- Export QRadar offense, timeline, and relevant events (4624/4625, 4728/4729 if present).
- Enrich and screenshot evidence. Contact admin owner/IT to confirm authorized activity.
- If policy allows: request immediate account lock or session revoke; escalate to L2/IR for containment.

# False Positive Examples

- Scheduled automated patching or admin scripts running from known management hosts.
- Legitimate cross-office admin tasks via corporate VPN or bastion host.
