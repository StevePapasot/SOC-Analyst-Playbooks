A user account has logged into Office 365 (Azure AD / Microsoft Entry ID) from a location, device, or IP address that deviates from their normal behavior.

## **Investigation workflow**

### Step 1. Open and Review the Offense

‚Üí Confirm which account, where and how suspicious login happened. 

*Find: Username, Source IP, Destination IP, Event Name, Timeframe and log source.*

What we want to see?

1. Is the same user successfully logged in?
2. Is the source IP internal or external?
3. Are the logs successful or failed?

### **Step 2. Focus on user behavior**

‚Üí When and where he usually connects?

- Check the destination IP. Is it legitimate MS infrastructure?
- Is the username the same? Consistent.

<!!!> Make authentication Analysis

Observe MFA - and device- related alerts.

ex. 

- `LogonError-UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequiredInterrupt`
- `LogonError-DeviceNotCompliantDeviceManagementRequired`
- `Login Error Device Authentication Required`

The above indicated that MFA or conditional access checks were applied and paused.

*** On the behavior check where did he logged in. Did he do something not normal?

<!> Pay attention on the change of the event on the Timeframe. When did the alert hit?

example investigation steps.

## üß≠ Investigation Steps ‚Äì *Suspicious Office365 Login*

1. **Opened the offense** ‚Üí Collected alert details (source IP, username, destination IP, magnitude, rule name).
2. **Excluded CRE filter** ‚Üí Focused only on raw portal_azure events.
3. **Checked source IP** ‚Üí Found `194.116.208.241` (HostRoyale VPN, India-registered, Greece-based).
4. **Verified MFA/device events** ‚Üí Saw MFA and compliance prompts ‚Üí authentication valid.
5. **Checked user history (30 days)** ‚Üí Normal activity (Teams, SharePoint, file access).
6. **Confirmed username consistency** ‚Üí Same user across all events.
7. **Analyzed IP behavior** ‚Üí VPN/cloud IPs, all European, not malicious.
8. **Correlated all data** ‚Üí No signs of compromise or privilege actions.
9. **Classified alert** ‚Üí **False Positive (legit user using VPN).**
10. **Recommended actions** ‚Üí Mark FP in QRadar, note VPN ISP, continue monitoring.
